if you pause for a second and think about the irony in human nature, it's really interesting

here we are, children and adult, man and woman, young and old, celebrating and making fun of death

fear has become commercialized

we dress up as skeletons and joke about ghosts

yet at the same time

**innocent are being turned into skeletons**

refugee camps are being bombed

children are losing their families

millions are facing the same fear we've commercialized

all of us could die at any second

so to cope, we make fun of it

if you pause for a second and think about the irony in human nature, it's really preplexing
