*I used to hate writing.*
*I still don't love it.*

*I used to hate writing.*
*Now, I've realized I need it.*

*Everyone says to start a blog. They say it's the best form of content.*
*But I didn't want to.*

## What defines a blog?

- Lengthy, long paragraphs.
- Formal writing.
- Personal advice.

Truth is, most blogs suck. Which is why I don't want one either.

On this "blog", posts are simply reflections. These include quotes I hear, stories I find interesting, topics that need to be discussed, and whatever is on my mind.

- The length doesn't matter. I'll write sentences and I'll write essays.
- The style doesn't matter. I'll be formal and I'll be informal.
- My advice doesn't matter. I can only give the advice of others that worked for me.

## Types of Content
- The tweets: Short stuff that I honestly can't be bothered to write more than a line or two on. you probably can't be bothered to read more than that either.
- The stories: Life's about making and telling stories. Who doesn't love a good one?
- the advice: Advice I've gotten that's worked for me and might work for you.
- The ideas: Stuff that should exist. No license required to steal.
- The posts: Blending everything together. (D - all of the above)
- The drafts: Half-baked or abandoned posts
