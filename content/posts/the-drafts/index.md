- [ ]  you don’t need social media - story of snapchat
- [ ]  overdeliver on projects to continue working
- [ ]  AI vs creativity - the backlash thats coming especially for AI art
- [ ]  the story of the water jug from "the creative act" book

- [ ]  The best editing is silent, same with best shots, best music, photography, etc
- [ ]  advice that sticks with you
- [ ]  first win of the day

- [ ]  why everything comes down to storytelling + how it's the biggest hack
- [ ]  niche down
- [ ]  painkillers vs vitamins vs candies: projects

- [ ]  Productive procrastination
- [ ]  losing the meaning of relaxation, taking walks in the morning
- [ ]  leap of faith vs the leap of a fool
- [ ]  Islam vs Music (focus on the psychology of music)
    - halal v haram music research
    - debunking music myths one at a time
    - quran shouldnt be used as music, what it should be used for
    - issues with current “halal” music
    - what is Islam’s alternative for music throughout history
    - why is music hated on right now by Muslims
    - music is all about rhythm
        - exploring current halal rhythm
    - issues with current normalized music
    - why almost every youth listens to music on a daily basis, full of statistics of spotify, youth, etc and why music is such a big industry etc
    - we cant tell people to stop listening to music without an alternative, and if quran is not that alternative then what is?
- [ ]  issues with digital productivity
    - https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/09/to-do-list-productivity-apps/675314/
        - Productivity is a source of anxiety for many people, tied to notions of self-worth. The tech industry capitalizes on this by selling digital tools for optimization.
        - Simple paper to-do lists are often more effective for getting things done than digital tools. Writing tasks down clears your mind and keeps the list physically present.
        - Digital calendars, reminders, and productivity apps can be distracting and encourage trivial tasks. They work best for office jobs with predictable schedules.
        - Handwriting a to-do list aids cognition and memory more than typing. The act of writing helps recall and organize your thoughts.
        - To-do lists should be simple, not organized or aesthetic. Just write down tasks, cross them off as you finish, and rewrite the next day's list.
        Some research suggests list-making improves working memory, and handwriting aids learning and memory versus typing.
        - Simple paper to-do lists are low-tech and don't require buying products. The power is their simplicity and physical presence.
- [ ]  using noise for concentration
    - I started this article after seeing multiple talk about brown noise + discovering how my watch instantly wakes me up with a simple tune
    - White noise, hearing in mother’s womb
    - pink noise
    - brown noise
    - smoothened brown noise
    - adding ambient music
    - green noise
    - isochronic tunes
    - music that instantly boosts productivity
    - Subliminal affirmations
    - “digital caffeine”
    - Polyrhythmic Music
    - Concentration for people with ADHD
