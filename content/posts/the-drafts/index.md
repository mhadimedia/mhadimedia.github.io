        - Productivity is a source of anxiety for many people, tied to notions of self-worth. The tech industry capitalizes on this by selling digital tools for optimization.
        - Simple paper to-do lists are often more effective for getting things done than digital tools. Writing tasks down clears your mind and keeps the list physically present.
        - Digital calendars, reminders, and productivity apps can be distracting and encourage trivial tasks. They work best for office jobs with predictable schedules.
        - Handwriting a to-do list aids cognition and memory more than typing. The act of writing helps recall and organize your thoughts.
        - To-do lists should be simple, not organized or aesthetic. Just write down tasks, cross them off as you finish, and rewrite the next day's list.
        Some research suggests list-making improves working memory, and handwriting aids learning and memory versus typing.
        - Simple paper to-do lists are low-tech and don't require buying products. The power is their simplicity and physical presence.

    - Subliminal affirmations
