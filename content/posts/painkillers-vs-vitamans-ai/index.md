Tony Fadell described how the best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins. 

A painkiller solves a major issue. Something wrong. A problem that shouldn't exist.

A vitamin is an addition. It enhances you. It doesn't solve a problem, it assists a solution.

With the rise of AI, most new ideas aren't even vitamins anymore, let along painkillers.

They're candies. 

Soely for the purpose of enjoyment.

Is your idea a painkiller?
