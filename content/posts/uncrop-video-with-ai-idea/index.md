I like to keep a list with all the ideas that come to my head at the most random times. Sometimes I'm about to fall asleep, sometimes I'm on the subway, and sometimes I'm in class. Whenever I have an idea, I try to write it down. Some ideas I try to implement, some I don't. But instead of letting them go to waste, I've decided to share them for others to potentially find. Maybe even in the future, 10 years from now.

These ideas do not require any licenses to steal. But I'd love to help you get started with them. Or work with you to build them. Or just use them once you've built them. If you're interested, feel free to reach out at [info@mhadimedia.com](mailto:info@mhadimedia.com).

## Uncrop.Video
### Original Idea
> Uncrop.video, takes any video and changes the ratio to anything using AI. Can also be used to make any movie suitable for vertical viewing on a phone.

### Adjusted Concept
We've seen the release of tools such as Adobe Generative Expand and Clipdrop Uncrop, that can take any image and expand it to any size using artificial intelligence (AI). These tools can be very beneficial for adjusting content to the perfect ratio to fit the device the content is being viewed from. For example, horizontal images can be expanded from the top and bottom to fit a phone screen, or vertical images can be expanded from the left and right sides to fit a computer screen.

If this concept is applied to video, it can be a game-changer. Companies have tried introducing vertical movies before but have failed as those movies need to be shot specifically with a vertical ratio in mind. But with the introduction of AI, any video content can be expanded to account for any ratio, without cropping in and losing content on the screen.

## Progress
- Domain purchased: [https://uncrop.video](uncrop.video)
  - *Note: Never buy a domain until you know your project is going to work. $28 down the drain. Contact me if you're interested in purchasing it.*
- Research done: Adobe Generative Expand, Clipdrop Uncrop, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney expand.

## Failures
It's easy to expand one frame of a video. And a second. And a third. You could theoretically split any video into frames and expand each one. The issue comes up when you actually place those frames back into a video. There are inconsistencies between each one. This is a common issue faced when attempting to use AI to generate video. The frames rarely match up, leading to a lot of distortion and artifacts between each frame. For example, one expanded frame can have a building at the top, while the other could have a tent. With each frame having different content, this approach simply doesn't work unless consistency between individual frames can be achieved.

Again, feel free to contact me if you're interested in this idea or purchasing the domain.
