description: No robots, no nonsense, just a mind dump of reflections.

**What defines a blog?**

Lengthy, long paragraphs. Formal writing. Personal advice. Truth is, most blogs suck. Which is why I don't want one either. On this "blog" the posts are simply reflections. These include quotes I hear, stories I find interesting, topics that need to be discussed, and whatever is on my mind.

***This is merely a mind dump.***
