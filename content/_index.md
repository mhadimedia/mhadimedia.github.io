# What defines a blog?

- Lengthy, long paragraphs.
- Formal writing.
- Personal advice.

Truth is, most blogs suck. Which is why I don't want one either.

On this "blog" are simply reflections. These include quotes I hear, stories I find interesting, topics that need to be discussed, and whatever is on my mind.

> The length doesn't matter. 
I'll write sentences and I'll write essays.

> The style doesn't matter. 
I'll be formal and I'll be informal.

> My advice doesn't matter. 
I can only give the advice of others that worked for me.

***This is merely a mind dump.***
