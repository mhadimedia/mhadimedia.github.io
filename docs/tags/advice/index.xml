      <description>The sound designer says to start w/ music and have video flow it.
The video editor says to start w/ footage and have music flow to it.
The sound designer hates the video editor. The video editor hates the sound designer.
&amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t understand me.&amp;rdquo;
Two sides of the same story.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Productive procrastination&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s a term I learnt from screenwriter Rodney Rothman. A term that changed how I see work and could change how you see it too.
In an interview with Jeff Goldsmith, Rothman says “my habits are pretty neurotic, I find I do this very productive procrastination these days… I’ll do research, I’ll make notes, I’ll draw weird maps of ideas, like diagram the story in some weird way that only I understand.</description>

      <title>Reflections on reading</title>

      <description>For two years, I thought reading was the nerdiest thing in the world.
From an early age, I was obsessed with reading, but I would only read fiction. I thought that non-fiction was extremely boring and completely useless.
Until the age of 14, I would read around 100 books every year, probably even more. From mystery to adventure, reading served as my substitute for watching movies.
Then, one day, I stopped.</description>

      <title>Sins can be like Samosas</title>

      <description>I was at someone&amp;rsquo;s house the other day. We were sitting at the table eating lunch, and were discussing different cuisines. The host started describing their love for Indian food, and brought up Samosas. He started telling us a story of how some years back, he ate some Samosas. It&amp;rsquo;s a good story.
It was the Islamic month of Ramadan, where Muslims don&amp;rsquo;t eat or drink during the day for 30 days.</description>

      <title>Reflections on swearing and baby steps (they&#39;re related)</title>

      <description>I was considering whether or not to write this. I currently have maybe thirty more imporant things to do. But maybe someone will find this story interesting. Could be you. This is a personal reflection on swearing and baby steps. Trust me, they&amp;rsquo;re related.
Swearing is interesting. A set of words that you&amp;rsquo;re never supposed to use. But everyone uses them anyways. They&amp;rsquo;re bad, but at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re cool for using them.</description>

      <title>Question everything, but be open to learning</title>

      <description>Everyone around you is right. People older than you know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. You&amp;rsquo;re just a kid - you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, so just accept what everyone around you says. Stop asking questions!
Unfortunately, this is the mindset sometimes forced upon the young, that questioning is wrong. We&amp;rsquo;re told to accept what we hear and see.
This mindset is completely wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s a balanece to it to. Let me explain.</description>

      <title>Writing for an audience vs. writing for the sake of writing</title>

      <description>Start writing I spent five years creating all sorts of content. I edited promotional videos. I took pictures of nature. I designed posters for events. I planned YouTube videos. I experimented with all sorts of things, but there was always one thing I avoided. Writing.
Why, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know, but there was always a fear in the back of my mind that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at it. I used to have some sort of notion in my mind that humans can only be good at certain things, and that I should focus my skills on other forms of creative work.</description>
