      <description>Start writing I spent five years creating all sorts of content. I edited promotional videos. I took pictures of nature. I designed posters for events. I planned YouTube videos. I experimented with all sorts of things, but there was always one thing I avoided. Writing.
Why, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know, but there was always a fear in the back of my mind that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at it. I used to have some sort of notion in my mind that humans can only be good at certain things, and that I should focus my skills on other forms of creative work.</description>
