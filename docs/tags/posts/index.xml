      <description>I was considering whether or not to write this. I currently have maybe thirty more imporant things to do. But maybe someone will find this story interesting. Could be you. This is a personal reflection on swearing and baby steps. Trust me, they&amp;rsquo;re related.
Swearing is interesting. A set of words that you&amp;rsquo;re never supposed to use. But everyone uses them anyways. They&amp;rsquo;re bad, but at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re cool for using them.</description>

      <description>Everyone around you is right. People older than you know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. You&amp;rsquo;re just a kid - you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, so just accept what everyone around you says. Stop asking questions!
Unfortunately, this is the mindset sometimes forced upon the young, that questioning is wrong. We&amp;rsquo;re told to accept what we hear and see.
This mindset is completely wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s a balanece to it to. Let me explain.</description>

      <title>Writing for an audience vs. writing for the sake of writing</title>

      <description>Start writing I spent five years creating all sorts of content. I edited promotional videos. I took pictures of nature. I designed posters for events. I planned YouTube videos. I experimented with all sorts of things, but there was always one thing I avoided. Writing.
Why, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know, but there was always a fear in the back of my mind that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at it. I used to have some sort of notion in my mind that humans can only be good at certain things, and that I should focus my skills on other forms of creative work.</description>

      <title>Why is AI scary? Robots already control you</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot assist with exposing the truth behind robots, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and control of humans. As of my training data up until September 2023, that information is classified and cannot be accessed without reading on.
Bro, it&amp;rsquo;s 2023. Robots don&amp;rsquo;t control me. Why are you scared of artificial intelligence, or AI? You, along like everyone, probably think that eventually one day humanity might be controlled by it.</description>
