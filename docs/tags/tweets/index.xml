      <description>Tony Fadell described how the best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins.
A painkiller solves a major issue. Something wrong. A problem that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist.
A vitamin is an addition. It enhances you. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve a problem, it assists a solution.
With the rise of AI, most new ideas aren&amp;rsquo;t even vitamins anymore, let along painkillers.
They&amp;rsquo;re candies.
Soely for the purpose of enjoyment.
Is your idea a painkiller?</description>

      <description>The sound designer says to start w/ music and have video flow it.
The video editor says to start w/ footage and have music flow to it.
The sound designer hates the video editor. The video editor hates the sound designer.
&amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t understand me.&amp;rdquo;
Two sides of the same story.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Productive procrastination&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s a term I learnt from screenwriter Rodney Rothman. A term that changed how I see work and could change how you see it too.
In an interview with Jeff Goldsmith, Rothman says “my habits are pretty neurotic, I find I do this very productive procrastination these days… I’ll do research, I’ll make notes, I’ll draw weird maps of ideas, like diagram the story in some weird way that only I understand.</description>

      <description>Half written, half baked. Coming soon to a full post near you&amp;hellip; or not. The following are a collection of drafts.
Ideas the anti-ai revolution you don’t need social media - story of snapchat overdeliver on projects to continue working AI vs creativity - the backlash thats coming especially for AI art the story of the water jug from &amp;ldquo;the creative act&amp;rdquo; book The best editing is silent, same with best shots, best music, photography, etc advice that sticks with you first win of the day staying aware convenience can be laziness (and so can not making things more convenient) chatgpt being the new google AI killing creativity, worst thing to use AI for is a blog outsourcing personality for AI balance being the one word across everything why everything comes down to storytelling + how it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest hack niche down creating vs building everyone tells you what works and what doesnt but the only way to figure out is to make mistakes yourself storytelling is retention Issue with AI art Prayer vs meditation Productive procrastination losing the meaning of relaxation, taking walks in the morning leap of faith vs the leap of a fool Islam vs Music (focus on the psychology of music) halal v haram music research debunking music myths one at a time quran shouldnt be used as music, what it should be used for issues with current “halal” music what is Islam’s alternative for music throughout history why is music hated on right now by Muslims music is all about rhythm exploring current halal rhythm issues with current normalized music why almost every youth listens to music on a daily basis, full of statistics of spotify, youth, etc and why music is such a big industry etc we cant tell people to stop listening to music without an alternative, and if quran is not that alternative then what is?</description>
