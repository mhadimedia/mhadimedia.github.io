      <description>I was at someone&amp;rsquo;s house the other day. We were sitting at the table eating lunch, and were discussing different cuisines. The host started describing their love for Indian food, and brought up Samosas. He starte telling us a story of how some years back, he ate some Samosas. It&amp;rsquo;s a good story.
It was the Islamic month of Ramadan, where Muslims don&amp;rsquo;t eat or drink during the day for 30 days.</description>

      <title>Reflections on swearing and baby steps (they&#39;re related)</title>

      <description>I was considering whether or not to write this. I currently have maybe thirty more imporant things to do. But maybe someone will find this story interesting. Could be you. This is a personal reflection on swearing and baby steps. Trust me, they&amp;rsquo;re related.
Swearing is interesting. A set of words that you&amp;rsquo;re never supposed to use. But everyone uses them anyways. They&amp;rsquo;re bad, but at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re cool for using them.</description>

      <description>The following is adapted from a research paper I wrote for a college course. Originally meant to be five pages, it ended up being nineteen by the time I finished writing all my thoughts. Enjoy the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.
For the longest time, animations have tried to mimic real-life imagery through their lighting, framing, characters, and setting. But what happens when animators break that boundary?</description>

      <title>Question everything, but be open to learning</title>

      <description>Everyone around you is right. People older than you know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. You&amp;rsquo;re just a kid - you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, so just accept what everyone around you says. Stop asking questions!
Unfortunately, this is the mindset sometimes forced upon the young, that questioning is wrong. We&amp;rsquo;re told to accept what we hear and see.
This mindset is completely wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s a balanece to it to. Let me explain.</description>

      <title>Writing for an audience vs. writing for the sake of writing</title>
      <link>https://mhadi.blog/posts/writing-for-audience/</link>

      <description>Start writing I spent five years creating all sorts of content. I edited promotional videos. I took pictures of nature. I designed posters for events. I planned YouTube videos. I experimented with all sorts of things, but there was always one thing I avoided. Writing.
Why, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know, but there was always a fear in the back of my mind that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at it. I used to have some sort of notion in my mind that humans can only be good at certain things, and that I should focus my skills on other forms of creative work.</description>

      <title>Why is AI scary? Robots already control you</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot assist with exposing the truth behind robots, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and control of humans. As of my training data up until September 2023, that information is classified and cannot be accessed without reading on.
Bro, it&amp;rsquo;s 2023. Robots don&amp;rsquo;t control me. Why are you scared of artificial intelligence, or AI? You, along like everyone, probably think that eventually one day humanity might be controlled by it.</description>

      <description>I used to hate writing. I still don&amp;rsquo;t love it.
I used to hate writing. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I need it.
Everyone says to start a blog. They say it&amp;rsquo;s the best form of content. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.

What defines a blog? Lengthy, long paragraphs. Formal writing. Personal advice. Truth is, most blogs suck.</description>

      <description>About the Blog What defines a blog? Lengthy, long paragraphs. Formal writing. Personal advice. Truth is, most blogs suck. Which is why I don&amp;rsquo;t want one either.
On this &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;, posts are simply reflections. These include quotes I hear, stories I find interesting, topics that need to be discussed, and whatever is on my mind.
The length doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I&amp;rsquo;ll write sentences and I&amp;rsquo;ll write essays. The style doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I&amp;rsquo;ll be formal and I&amp;rsquo;ll be informal.</description>
