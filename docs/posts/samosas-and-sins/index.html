      <p>I was at someone&rsquo;s house the other day. We were sitting at the table eating lunch, and were discussing different cuisines. The host started describing their love for Indian food, and brought up Samosas. He started telling us a story of how some years back, he ate some Samosas. <em>It&rsquo;s a good story.</em></p>
<p>It was the Islamic month of Ramadan, where Muslims don&rsquo;t eat or drink during the day for 30 days. He was at someone else&rsquo;s house, and they were sitting down to break their fast for that day. This house had a plate of beautiful, delicious Samosas on the table.</p>
<p>He mentioned how good they looked, how tasty they were, how tempting it was for him to eat more of them, and how he felt a certain regret after eating more than one or two, but had to keep going because they were just so delicious. And, of course, how he faced a punishment from eating too many the next day.</p>
<p>Then, this host I was in a conversation with made a comparison I felt was really interesting. Samosas, he said, reminded him of sins. Enticing, begging for more, and a punishment awaiting you in the end.</p>
<p>Not that eating Samosas is a sin - that would be horrible.</p>
<p>But I found this comparison quite interesting. I noticed how in life, it actually applies to a lot of scenarios as well, not just sins.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the example of procrastination. It is so damn easy for me to pull out my phone and start scrolling. Our brains have been trained to do this almost unconsciously. We might not even notice we&rsquo;re scrolling.</p>
<p>I have some friends who are in a gathering with others and are talking while scrolling through Instagram Reels. I&rsquo;m honestly not even sure if they&rsquo;re consciously doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enticing to procrastinate. It&rsquo;s easy to get started. Too easy. After a bit, you might feel some regret, but you gotta keep going. Suddenly, though, you come to your senses. What have you just done? It&rsquo;s been an hour. You have an assignment due tonight.</p>
<p>The punishment is either already upon you, or it&rsquo;s coming soon when you get that bad grade from your teacher, knowing you could have done a better job if you hadn&rsquo;t procrastinated.</p>
<p>If you look at life with the example of Samosas and Sins, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to notice what&rsquo;s good for you and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You could call these &ldquo;signs&rdquo; a blessing from nature. You could call them blessings from God. I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to call them, but I&rsquo;d go with the latter.</p>
<p>Things can seem enticing, but if you&rsquo;re going to regret them later on, there&rsquo;s probably a sign there.</p>
<p><strong>Remember the Samosa.</strong></p>
