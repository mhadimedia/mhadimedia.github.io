      <description>I was at someone&amp;rsquo;s house the other day. We were sitting at the table eating lunch, and were discussing different cuisines. The host started describing their love for Indian food, and brought up Samosas. He started telling us a story of how some years back, he ate some Samosas. It&amp;rsquo;s a good story.
It was the Islamic month of Ramadan, where Muslims don&amp;rsquo;t eat or drink during the day for 30 days.</description>

      <title>What if you could use AI to expand video to any size?</title>

      <description>I like to keep a list with all the ideas that come to my head at the most random times. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m about to fall asleep, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m on the subway, and sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m in class. Whenever I have an idea, I try to write it down. Some ideas I try to implement, some I don&amp;rsquo;t. But instead of letting them go to waste, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to share them for others to potentially find.</description>

      <title>Reflections on swearing and baby steps (they&#39;re related)</title>

      <description>I was considering whether or not to write this. I currently have maybe thirty more imporant things to do. But maybe someone will find this story interesting. Could be you. This is a personal reflection on swearing and baby steps. Trust me, they&amp;rsquo;re related.
Swearing is interesting. A set of words that you&amp;rsquo;re never supposed to use. But everyone uses them anyways. They&amp;rsquo;re bad, but at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re cool for using them.</description>

      <title>A Cinematic Leap into Imagination: Across the Spider-Verse</title>

      <description>The following is adapted from a research paper I wrote for a college course. Originally meant to be five pages, it ended up being nineteen by the time I finished writing all my thoughts. Enjoy the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.
For the longest time, animations have tried to mimic real-life imagery through their lighting, framing, characters, and setting. But what happens when animators break that boundary?</description>

      <title>Question everything, but be open to learning</title>

      <description>Everyone around you is right. People older than you know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. You&amp;rsquo;re just a kid - you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything, so just accept what everyone around you says. Stop asking questions!
Unfortunately, this is the mindset sometimes forced upon the young, that questioning is wrong. We&amp;rsquo;re told to accept what we hear and see.
This mindset is completely wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s a balanece to it to. Let me explain.</description>

      <title>Writing for an audience vs. writing for the sake of writing</title>
      <link>https://mhadi.blog/posts/writing-for-audience/</link>

      <description>Start writing I spent five years creating all sorts of content. I edited promotional videos. I took pictures of nature. I designed posters for events. I planned YouTube videos. I experimented with all sorts of things, but there was always one thing I avoided. Writing.
Why, I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know, but there was always a fear in the back of my mind that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at it. I used to have some sort of notion in my mind that humans can only be good at certain things, and that I should focus my skills on other forms of creative work.</description>

      <title>Why is AI scary? Robots already control you</title>
      <link>https://mhadi.blog/posts/robots-control-you/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot assist with exposing the truth behind robots, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and control of humans. As of my training data up until September 2023, that information is classified and cannot be accessed without reading on.
Bro, it&amp;rsquo;s 2023. Robots don&amp;rsquo;t control me. Why are you scared of artificial intelligence, or AI? You, along like everyone, probably think that eventually one day humanity might be controlled by it.</description>

      <description>I used to hate writing. I still don&amp;rsquo;t love it.
I used to hate writing. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I need it.
Everyone says to start a blog. They say it&amp;rsquo;s the best form of content. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.
Everyone says to start a blog. They say it&amp;rsquo;s the best form of content. But now I need to.
What defines a blog? Lengthy, long paragraphs. Formal writing. Personal advice. Truth is, most blogs suck.</description>

      <description>Half written, half baked. Coming soon to a full post near you&amp;hellip; or not. The following are a collection of drafts.
Ideas you don’t need social media - story of snapchat overdeliver on projects to continue working AI vs creativity - the backlash thats coming especially for AI art the story of the water jug from &amp;ldquo;the creative act&amp;rdquo; book your story is important, what about their story? antagonist of a story also has their own story The best editing is silent, same with best shots, best music, photography, etc advice that sticks with you first win of the day staying aware convenience can be laziness (and so can not making things more convenient) outsourcing personality for AI chatgpt being the new google AI killing creativity, worst thing to use AI for is a blog balance being the one word across everything why everything comes down to storytelling + how it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest hack niche down painkillers vs vitamins vs candies: projects creating vs building everyone tells you what works and what doesnt but the only way to figure out is to make mistakes yourself storytelling is retention Issue with AI art Prayer vs meditation Productive procrastination losing the meaning of relaxation, taking walks in the morning leap of faith vs the leap of a fool Islam vs Music (focus on the psychology of music) halal v haram music research debunking music myths one at a time quran shouldnt be used as music, what it should be used for issues with current “halal” music what is Islam’s alternative for music throughout history why is music hated on right now by Muslims music is all about rhythm exploring current halal rhythm issues with current normalized music why almost every youth listens to music on a daily basis, full of statistics of spotify, youth, etc and why music is such a big industry etc we cant tell people to stop listening to music without an alternative, and if quran is not that alternative then what is?</description>
